# SGR Agent Core

**SGR Agent Core** is an open-source agentic framework for building intelligent research agents using Schema-Guided Reasoning (SGR). The project provides a core library with an extendable `BaseAgent` interface implementing a three-phase architecture and multiple ready-to-use research agent implementations built on top of it.

The library includes extensible tools for search, reasoning, and clarification, real-time streaming responses, and an OpenAI-compatible REST API. Works with any OpenAI-compatible LLM, including local models for fully private research.

## Why use SGR Agent Core?

* **Schema-Guided Reasoning** — SGR combines structured reasoning with flexible tool selection
* **Multiple Agent Types** — Choose from `SGRAgent`, `ToolCallingAgent`, or `SGRToolCallingAgent`
* **Extensible Architecture** — Easy to create custom agents and tools
* **OpenAI-Compatible API** — Drop-in replacement for OpenAI API endpoints
* **Real-time Streaming** — Built-in support for streaming responses via SSE
* **Production Ready** — Battle-tested with comprehensive test coverage and Docker support

## Quick Start

### Running with Docker

The fastest way to get started is using Docker:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vamplabai/sgr-agent-core.git
cd sgr-agent-core

# Create directories with write permissions for all
sudo mkdir -p logs reports
sudo chmod 777 logs reports

# Copy and edit the configuration file
cp examples/sgr_deep_research/config.yaml.example examples/sgr_deep_research/config.yaml
# Edit examples/sgr_deep_research/config.yaml and set your API keys

# Run the container
docker run --rm -i \
  --name sgr-agent \
  -p 8010:8010 \
  -v $(pwd)/examples/sgr_deep_research:/app/examples/sgr_deep_research:ro \
  -v $(pwd)/logs:/app/logs \
  -v $(pwd)/reports:/app/reports \
  ghcr.io/vamplabai/sgr-agent-core:latest \
  --config-file /app/examples/sgr_deep_research/config.yaml \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 8010
```

The API server will be available at `http://localhost:8010`. Interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) is available at `http://localhost:8010/docs`.

### Installation

If you want to use SGR Agent Core as a Python library (framework):

```bash
pip install sgr-agent-core
```

See the [Installation Guide](installation.md) for detailed instructions and the [Using as Library](../framework/first-steps.md) guide to get started.
